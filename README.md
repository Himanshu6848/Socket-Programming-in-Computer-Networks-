# 🔌 Socket Programming in C (Linux Only) 

A complete collection of TCP and UDP-based socket programming examples written in **C for Linux systems**. This repository helps you practice client-server communication and understand the fundamentals of network programming.

> 🐧 **Note:** These programs are designed for **Linux/Unix environments only**. They use POSIX-compliant system calls and **will not work on Windows** without modification.

## ⚙️ How to Run (Linux Only)

### 🛠 Step 1: Compile the Files
Use `gcc` to compile both server and client:
  gcc server.c -o server
  gcc client.c -o client
💡 Run this inside any of the folders like TCP/2.Chat Application/ or UDP/3.Reverse Number/

▶️ Step 2: Run the Server
./server

💬 Step 3: Run the Client (in another terminal)
./client
⚠️ Always start the server before the client connects.
